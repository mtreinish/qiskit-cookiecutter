# cookiecutter-qiskit

This repository contains a cookiecutter template for creating new Qiskit
project repositories. It is intended for use with the
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) tool to generate
an empty repositoriy with all the boilerplate pre-populated.

To use it first ensure that `cookiecutter` is installed with:

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

Then you can create a new project with

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/mtreinish/cookiecutter-qiskit
```

which will ask you for a few values, mainly the project name and author string,
and create the project in your current working directory.
